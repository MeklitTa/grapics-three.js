interactive 3D Product Viewer Application using Three.js,
where users can explore a "product" built entirely using basic geometries (like boxes, cylinders, spheres, etc.).
The application should allow for both manual interaction (mouse controls) and automated camera rotation around the object.
This project incorporates foundational concepts from Discover Three.js, including scene setup, mesh composition, lighting, raycasting, animation, and camera controls.
